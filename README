ABOUT

  allium generates a set of HTML documents which represent the total set of tor
  relays at the time of execution

  allium is heavily inspired by the official tor metrics project[0] and serves
  as a javascript-free, statically-generated clean room implementation. the
  primary goals of the project are to be fast (static), use few API queries
  (one), and to present information in a condensed, readable format
